# WeWork Labs - Beta Branch Directory App

Long name, huh? This was the base application used for the community of startups at the first batch of WeWork Labs in New York, 205 Hudson St. It has since been deprecated since me and bunch of others who started in the first batch have graduated.

Rails 5 backend as API,
React+Redux as Frontend.

Separate readme's for both folders are available, cool. 

Everything is hacky. But it's a nice starter for "Admin Dashboard" style projects where most of the frontend functionality is auth-only content.
